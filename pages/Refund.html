        <h2 class="refund__title">Refund Policy
        </h2>

        <p class="refund__paragraph">A 100% refund will be made only in the event of a cancellation right after we
            showcase the sample graphics in the
            kickoff Meeting, within 7 days of signing the initial contract. All sales are final. A project may be split
            into monthly
            payments as a courtesy to the client. Once a payment or deposit is made, it is non-refundable.</p>
        <p class="refund__paragraph">All digital marketing packages including Social Media Management and Social Media
            Ads are not refundable, but the client
            may cancel at any time with a written notice. Read Cancellation Policy above.</p>
        <p class="refund__paragraph">We do not offer any refund for services already delivered, started, or any other
            miscellaneous charges which are
            non-recoverable for ZANMEDIA. No payment will be refunded once an initial draft is provided. There are no
            partial
            refunds for projects mid-way through a milestone phase.</p>
        <p class="refund__paragraph">There are no refunds or credits of any kind for Social Media Ads. Once you have
            spent money for ads on Google, Facebook,
            Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. you will almost certainly never see that returned again, for any reason, no matter
            how
            compelling or justifiable your case may seem.</p>
        <p class="refund__paragraph">We do not offer refunds on deposits or payments for projects that are abandoned or
            lay dormant for more than 30 days. If
            you signed up for our services but did not make use of them, then you are still entitled to pay us.</p>
        <p class="refund__paragraph">All billing cycles for agreed services will continue until The Client Organization
            sends a cancellation notice in
            writing. Read Cancellation Policy above.
