        </h2>

        <p class="refund__paragraph">Since the we prepare content for the whole month in advance we do not provide
            refunds after the service is purchased,
            which you acknowledge prior to purchasing any services on the Website. Please make sure that you've
            carefully
            read
            service description before making a purchase. We offer Free 7 day Trial which does not require you to pay
            beforehand.</p>

        <p class="refund__paragraph">All sales are final. Once a payment or deposit is made, it is non-refundable.</p>

        <p class="refund__paragraph">All digital marketing packages including Social Media Management and Social
            Media Ads are non refundable, but the client
            may cancel at any time with a written notice. Read Cancellation Policy above.</p>

        <p class="refund__paragraph">We do not offer any refund for services already delivered, started, or any
            other miscellaneous charges which are
            non-recoverable for ZANMEDIA. No payment will be refunded as we have already made content for the whole
            month in
            advance. There are no partial refunds for projects mid-way through a milestone phase.</p>

        <p class="refund__paragraph">There are no refunds or credits of any kind for Social Media Ads. Once you
            have spent money for ads on Google, Facebook,
            Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. you will almost certainly never see that returned again, for any reason, no matter
            how
            compelling or justifiable your case may seem.</p>

        <p class="refund__paragraph">We do not offer refunds on deposits or payments for projects that are
            abandoned or lay dormant for more than 30 days. If
            you signed up for our services but did not make use of them, then you are still entitled to pay us.</p>

        <p class="refund__paragraph">All billing cycles for agreed services will continue until The Client
            Organization sends a cancellation notice in
            writing. Read Cancellation Policy above.
