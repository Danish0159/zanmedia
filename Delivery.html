        </h2>
        <p class="delivery__paragraph">ZANMEDIA will create social media content according to instructions we are given by the client during the onboarding
        process, which include: brand guidelines, social media guidelines, social media resources, target audience, and more.
        Content will be well researched from trusted sources, as well as the client’s website. It is the client’s responsibility
        to ensure information on their website is correct.</p>
        <p class="delivery__paragraph">We will make every effort to ensure our social media output is correct, but it is ultimately the responsibility of the
        client to ensure the content being posted is accurate and to inform us of any errors. We are not liable for damages
        should any inaccurate information be published on your social media accounts.</p>
        <p class="delivery__paragraph">We recommend that you keep us up to date and informed of any news or changes to your business.</p>
        <p class="delivery__paragraph">Our social media posts and Facebook Ads service is designed to increase your brand awareness and generate new business.
        However, we cannot guarantee any results and are not liable for loss of earnings as a result of not gaining new business
        through our service. We make every effort to ensure the ad campaigns we run deliver results, but we also rely on the
        client’s website being well optimised for conversions. It is the client’s responsibility to convert any leads into
        business.</p>
