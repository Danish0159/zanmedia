        <h2 class="terms__title">Welcome to ZANMEDIA
        </h2>

        <p class="terms__paragraph">
            By signing up as a client of ZANMEDIA you are agreeing to these terms and conditions. These terms and conditions set out
            what’s expected of both parties and offers protection to both you and us. These terms and conditions can change at any
            time without notice so we recommend coming back regularly to check for any updates.
        </p>

        <h2 class="terms__subtitle">Payments
        </h2>

        <p class="terms__paragraph">
            ZANMEDIA takes payment up front for the month ahead. Payment is taken by card on the day the client signs up. The client
            then enters a monthly rolling subscription and payment will be taken on the same day each month, unless otherwise
            agreed.
        </p>

        <h2 class="terms__subtitle">Refund Policy
        </h2>


        <p class="terms__paragraph">
            All digital marketing packages including Social Media Management and Social Media Ads are non-refundable, but the client
            may cancel at any time with a written notice. 
        </p>

        <p class="terms__paragraph">
            Contract terms will determine if full, partial, or no refund is due to you if we have not fulfilled our obligations to
            deliver the work required under the agreement. Please make sure that you've carefully read service description before
            making a purchase.
        </p>

        <h2 class="terms__subtitle">Communication
        </h2>

        <p class="terms__paragraph">ZANMEDIA aims to respond promptly to all client enquiries, returning most tickets and emails within 24 hours. Emails are
        not responded to over the weekend.
        </p>
        <p class="terms__paragraph">During busier periods it may take a little longer for us to respond but we will always try to prioritise urgent
        messages.</p>

        <p class="terms__paragraph">Please note that ZANMEDIA cannot be held responsible for damages or loss of earnings should we take longer than 24 hours
        to respond.
        </p>

        <h2 class="terms__subtitle">Ownership
        </h2>

        <p class="terms__paragraph">All content created for the client by ZANMEDIA becomes the copyright of the client and the client is free to reuse this
        content. However, ZANMEDIA reserves the right to reuse and repurpose (unless the content contains client-copyrighted
        media items provided to ZANMEDIA by the client) the content produced for other client accounts.
        </p>

        <h2 class="terms__subtitle">Content and Service
        </h2>

        <p class="terms__paragraph">ZANMEDIA will create social media content according to instructions we are given by the client during the onboarding
        process, which include: brand guidelines, social media guidelines, social media resources, target audience, and more.
        Content will be well researched from trusted sources, as well as the client’s website. It is the client’s responsibility
        to ensure information on their website is correct.</p>

        <p class="terms__paragraph">We will make every effort to ensure our social media output is correct, but it is ultimately the responsibility of the
        client to ensure the content being posted is accurate and to inform us of any errors. We are not liable for damages
        should any inaccurate information be published on your social media accounts.
        </p>
        <p class="terms__paragraph">We recommend that you keep us up to date and informed of any news or changes to your business.
        </p>
        <p class="terms__paragraph">Our social media posts and Facebook Ads service is designed to increase your brand awareness and generate new business.
        However, we cannot guarantee any results and are not liable for loss of earnings as a result of not gaining new business
        through our service. We make every effort to ensure the ad campaigns we run deliver results, but we also rely on the
        client’s website being well optimised for conversions. It is the client’s responsibility to convert any leads into
        business.
        </p>

        <h2 class="terms__subtitle">GDPR
        </h2>

        <p class="terms__paragraph">ZANMEDIA takes data protection and GDPR very seriously and complies with all regulations. You can read our privacy
        policy  <a href="./Privacy.html">here.</a>  We hold client contact information centrally and securely. This information is for internal use and can be
        used for marketing purposes.</p>

        <p class="terms__paragraph">Passwords and other sensitive data provided by the client to ZANMEDIA will be stored securely. Whilst we don’t usually
        require any social media login details, it is necessary from time to time and we recommend sharing these details
        securely.</p>

        <p class="terms__paragraph">All sensitive information is securely deleted when a client cancels their subscription with ZANMEDIA, although contact
        information may be retained for future marketing purposes.</p>

        <p class="terms__paragraph"><b> These terms were last updated in February 2022.</b></p>
